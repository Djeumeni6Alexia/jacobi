Description: The jacobi method, due to the german mathematician Karl jacobi, is an iterative 
            method for solving a matrix system of the form Ax=B. For this, we use a sequence
            x^k which converges to a fixed point x, solution of the system of linear equations.
            we want to build the algoritme for given x^0, the sequence x^(k+1)=F(x^k) with k belonging to N.
